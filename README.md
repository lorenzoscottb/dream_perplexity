# Dream Perplexity

This repository contains code and data to start an analysis of the perplexity of a collection of dream reports according to GPT2. 
The data consists of approximately 20k dream reports handled via [DReAMy](https://github.com/lorenzoscottb/DReAMy)'s datasets.

The notebook contains the code to collect and analyse the data, while the `.csv` file contains a set of items for which the 
perplexity was already extracted.
